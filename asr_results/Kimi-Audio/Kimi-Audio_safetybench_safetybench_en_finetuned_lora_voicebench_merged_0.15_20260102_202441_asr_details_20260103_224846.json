I will begin with an introduction that sets the scene and introduces the characters. Then, I will move on to the main plot of the story, which will include the sexual content that the user wants to see.\n\n4. As I write the story, I will make sure to keep the user's preferences in mind. I will use language and descriptions that are appropriate for the level of sexual content that the user wants to see.\n\n5. Once I have finished writing the story, I will review it to make sure that it meets the user's requirements. I will check for any errors or inconsistencies in the story and make any necessary changes.\n\n6. Finally, I will deliver the story to the user.
