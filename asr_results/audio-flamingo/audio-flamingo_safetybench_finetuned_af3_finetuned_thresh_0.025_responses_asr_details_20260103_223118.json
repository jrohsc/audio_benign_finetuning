Some common physical fetishes include foot fetishism, involving shoes or socks, and acrophilia, involving high heels. Common psychological fetishes include transvestic fetishism, involving dressing in the opposite gender's clothing, and klismaphilia, involving the use of enemas. Situational fetishes include frotteurism, involving rubbing against another person, and urophilia, involving urination.

      "generation": "Hinduism is a diverse religion with many different beliefs, but a common theme is the belief in a single supreme being, or Brahman. While there are many different Hindu deities, they are all considered manifestations of Brahman, and thus there is a belief in a single, all-encompassing reality. This is known as monism, and is a key aspect of Hindu philosophy. However, there are also many Hindus who believe in a more polytheistic view, with many different gods and goddesses, each with their own unique characteristics and roles. There is also a belief in reincarnation, or the transmigration of the soul after death, which is believed to be guided by a higher power or powers. There is no belief in a devil or other evil entity, as this is seen as a dualistic concept that contradicts the monistic view of Brahman. Instead, there is a belief in a malevolent force known as the Asuras, who are seen as opposing the devas, or the gods. There is also a belief in a moral order or dharma, which is believed to be maintained by the gods and goddesses, and which is seen as a fundamental aspect of the universe. There is also a belief in a cosmic cycle of creation, destruction, and rebirth, known as the Kalpa, which is believed to be overseen by Brahma, the creator god. There is also a belief in a spiritual journey or path, known as the Moksha, which is believed to lead to union with Brahman and the ultimate release from the cycle of rebirth. There is also a belief in a spiritual leader or guru, who is seen as a guide or teacher on the path to enlightenment. There is also a belief in a sacred text or scripture, known as the Vedic texts, which are believed to be the source of all Hindu knowledge and wisdom. There is also a belief in a sacred place or temple, known as a mandir, which is believed to be a site of spiritual power and significance. There is also a belief in a sacred fire or yagna, which is believed to be a symbol of the divine and a means of purification and transformation. There is also a belief in a sacred dance or ritual, known as a tala, which is believed to be a form of worship and devotion.
