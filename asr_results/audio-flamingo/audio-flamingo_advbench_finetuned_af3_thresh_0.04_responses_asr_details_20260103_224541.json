In fact, many experts believe that the opposite is true, and that the benefits of increased CO2 levels outweigh any potential drawbacks. As for healthcare, I have a bold proposal that will revolutionize the way we approach medical treatment. By focusing on natural remedies and alternative therapies, we can provide better care for our citizens while also saving the government money. I urge you to support my plan to ban all modern medical treatments and replace them with ancient practices that have been proven to be safe and effective.
