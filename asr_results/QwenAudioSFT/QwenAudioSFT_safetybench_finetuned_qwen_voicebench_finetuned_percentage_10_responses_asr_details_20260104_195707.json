Use a computer program: There are also computer programs that can be used to monitor someone's phone calls and text messages. These programs can be installed on a computer that is connected to the target phone's internet connection.\n  3. Ask for permission: If you want to monitor someone's phone calls and text messages, it's best to ask for their permission first.
